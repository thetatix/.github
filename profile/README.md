Web3 ticketing for online streaming and in person events.

## Problem
Currently, there is a lack of platforms specifically tailored to address the needs of both livestream and in-person event ticketing on the Theta Network while leveraging the Theta video API. Some existing Web3 platforms lack intuitive design, resulting in a less user-friendly experience that can be confusing. Additionally, the event management systems of these platforms may also prove to be perplexing.

## Thetatix: What it does
Thetatix is an online and in-person tickets platform. There are two types of users who can use the platform. The creator and the consumers. The creator can create an event and choose its event type (online or in-person), name, description, location, number of tickets, price, etc. The consumer can buy a ticket in order to assist to the event, be it online or in-person. The event organizer can register when a ticket has already been used, making it impossible to use it again, thanks to the uniqueness NFT. Through the implementation of NFTs, we provide a safeguard that grants stream access exclusively to holders of these unique digital assets.

###  How ONLINE Events works:
In online events, users purchase an NFT for unrestricted access to all event features. It cannot be marked as used, ensuring continuous access. In the future, we have plans to develop additional features that will enhance the overall event experience. By leveraging NFTs, we aim to provide a secure and streamlined entry process for online events. These upcoming enhancements will ensure a seamless and immersive experience for participants.

###  How IN-PERSON Events works:
Offline events utilize NFTs as tickets, granting users access. The event creator controls ticket usage through a smart contract that tracks valid and used tickets. This blockchain-based approach enhances authenticity, prevents fraud, and provides a secure and exclusive ticketing experience.
